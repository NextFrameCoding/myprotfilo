<p>The Tragedy of Karbala

The tragedy of Karbala is a story of courage, sacrifice, and unwavering faith. Imam Hussain (peace be upon him) and his family <br/>faced immense hardship and oppression, standing for justice against tyranny. Despite being vastly outnumbered,<br/> they remained steadfast, giving their lives so that truth and honor would prevail. Their sacrifice continues to inspire generations, reminding us of the cost of standing for what is right.</p><BR/>
